/* <- Start of a comment in CSS

CSS has various rules. Rules are written in the format of:
selector {
    property: value
} 
    
'*' stands for Universal Selector

type selector or element selector will rule over all elements of the given element type eg: 
div {
  color: white;
}

You can govern a class with '.' before the class name eg:
.class-name {
  color: red;
}

You can govern an ID with '#' before the ID name eg:
#ID-name {
  color: blue;
}

You can group selectors with ',' if they share some of the same elements eg:
.read,
.unread {
  color: white;
  background-color: black;
}

.read {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

.unread {
  /* several unique declarations */
}

CSS Comments ends with the symbol -> */
