 CSS Comments starts with '/*' and ends with '*/'

CSS has various rules. Rules are written in the format of:
  selector {
      property: value
  } 
    
'*' stands for Universal Selector

type selector or element selector will rule over all elements of the given element type e.g. 
  div {
    color: white;
  }

You can govern a class with '.' before the class name e.g.
  .class-name {
    color: red;
  }

You can govern an ID with '#' before the ID name e.g.
  #ID-name {
    color: blue;
  }

You can group selectors with ',' if they share some of the same elements e.g.
  .read,
  .unread {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
  }

  .read {
    /* several unique declarations */
  }

  .unread {
    /* several unique declarations */
  }

You can chain multiple classes together, e.g.
  .class-name1.class-name2{

  }

You can also chain an ID and class together
  #ID-name.class-name{

  }

In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t
be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like
div and p would give us the selector divp, which wouldn’t work since the
selector would try to find a literal <divp> element, which doesn’t exist.

Descendant combinator is represented in CSS by a single space between selectors.

So something like .ancestor .child would select an element with the class child if it has an ancestor with the class ancestor.
Another way to think of it is child will only be selected if it is nested inside of ancestor, no matter how deep.
e.g.
  <!-- index.html -->

  <div class="ancestor"> <!-- A -->
    <div class="contents"> <!-- B -->
      <div class="contents"> <!-- C -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="contents"></div> <!-- D -->

  /* styles.css */

  .ancestor .contents {
    /* some declarations */
  }

In the above example, the first two elements with the contents class (B and C) would be selected, but that last element (D) won’t be.

Frequently used CSS properties:

1. color and background-color

The color property sets an element’s text color, while background-color sets, well, the background color of an element.
e.g.
  p {
    /* hex example: */
    color: #1100ff;
    /* rgb example: */
    color: rgb(100, 0, 127);
    /* rgba: a stands for alpha(opacity) and has the range from 0 to 1 example: */
    color: rgb(250, 45, 0, 0.6);
    /* hsl example: */
    color: hsl(15, 82%, 56%);
    /* hsla example: */
    color: hsl(250, 82%, 70%, 0.5);
  }

2. Typography Basics and text-align

  font-family
  If a browser cannot find or does not support the first font in a list, it will use the next one, then the next one and so on
  e.g. font-family: "Times New Roman", sans-serif;

  font-size
  e.g. font-size: 22px

  font-weight
  Affects the boldness of text, assuming the font supports the specified weight.
  e.g. font-weight: bold 

  or 

  A number between 1 and 1000 
  e.g. font-weight: 700

  text-align
  Will align text horizontally within an element
  e.g. text-align: center




<HTML NOTES>

You can add multiple classes to an element by using space, e.g. <div class="class-name1 class-name2 class-name3"></div>
