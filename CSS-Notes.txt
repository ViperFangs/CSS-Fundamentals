/* <- Start of a comment in CSS

CSS has various rules. Rules are written in the format of:
  selector {
      property: value
  } 
    
'*' stands for Universal Selector

type selector or element selector will rule over all elements of the given element type eg: 
  div {
    color: white;
  }

You can govern a class with '.' before the class name eg:
  .class-name {
    color: red;
  }

You can govern an ID with '#' before the ID name eg:
  #ID-name {
    color: blue;
  }

You can group selectors with ',' if they share some of the same elements eg:
  .read,
  .unread {
    color: white;
    background-color: black;
  }

  .read {
    /* several unique declarations */
  }

  .unread {
    /* several unique declarations */
  }

You can chain multiple classes together, eg:
  .class-name1.class-name2{

  }

You can also chain an ID and class together
  #ID-name.class-name{

  }

In general, you can’t chain more than one type selector since an element can’t
be two different types at once. For example, chaining two type selectors like
div and p would give us the selector divp, which wouldn’t work since the
selector would try to find a literal <divp> element, which doesn’t exist.

<HTML NOTES>

You can add multiple classes to an element by using space, eg:
  <div class="class-name1 class-name2 class-name3"></div>
